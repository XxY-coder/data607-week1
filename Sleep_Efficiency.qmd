# Approach

## Sleep efficiency dataset

I've chosen this dataset because a lot of people stay up late. By looking at the data, it records the time spent in each sleep stage, so then I want to see how different factors(caffeine, alcohol consumption, smoking status, and exercise) affect sleep quality.

## Compare the effects of various factors on sleep states
